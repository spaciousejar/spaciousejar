Hey, 

I'm Vicky, a Developer passionate about creating simple solutions to complex problems. 
I focus on digital interfaces, interactive experiences, and design-tech convergence.

I primarily work with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Git, and GitHub.


I am a huge fan of open-source and [have built projects](https://www.gitme.live/) used by many people.
